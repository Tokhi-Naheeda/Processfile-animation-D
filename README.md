# Processing Files

In this project, I created a "Processing Files" animation for a website. The task involved working with existing `index.html` and `styles/index.css` files, along with the images in the `images` folder. The goal was to fix issues with image paths, and then implement a smooth animation that simulates processing or loading of files.

### Languages Used
- **HTML** for structuring the webpage
- **CSS** for styling the page and implementing the animation

### Project Overview

I started by fixing the issue with the images in the existing `index.html` file. The images were not displaying correctly in the browser due to incorrect paths. Once I corrected the paths, I proceeded with the main task of creating an animation. The animation simulates the process of files being processed, with visual elements to give the illusion of progress.

Hereâ€™s what I did in the project:
- Fixed the broken image paths to ensure the images display correctly on the page.
- Created a simple but visually engaging animation to simulate the file processing effect.
- Used **CSS** for animation styling, ensuring it was smooth and matched the provided example.
